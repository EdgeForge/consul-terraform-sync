## Installation
Consul NIA is a daemon that runs alongside [Consul](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul), similar to other Consul ecosystem tools like [Consul Template](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template). Consul NIA is not included with the Consul binary and will need to be installed separately.

### Download
To install Consul NIA, find the appropriate package for your system and download it as a zip archive. Unzip the package to extract the binary named `consul-terraform-sync`. Move the consul-terraform-sync binary to a location available on your `$PATH`.

  1. Download a pre-compiled, released version from the [Consul NIA release page](https://releases.hashicorp.com/consul-terraform-sync/).
  1. Extract the binary using `unzip` or `tar`.
  1. Move the binary into `$PATH`.

```shell
$ wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/consul-terraform-sync/${VERSION}/consul-esm_${VERSION}_${OS}_${ARCH}.zip
$ unzip consul_nia_${VERSION}_${OS}_${ARCH}.zip
$ mv consul-terraform-sync /usr/local/bin/consul-terraform-sync
```

### Build from Source

You can also build Consul NIA from source.

  1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
  1. Pick a [version](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-terraform-sync/releases) or build from master.
  1. Build Consul NIA using the [Makefile](Makefile).
  1. The `consul-terraform-sync` binary is now installed to `$GOPATH/bin`.
