## Installation
Consul NIA is a daemon that runs alongside [Consul](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul), similar to other Consul ecosystem tools like [Consul Template](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template). Consul NIA is not included with the Consul binary and will need to be installed separately.

### Download
To install Consul NIA, find the appropriate package for your system and download it as a zip archive. Unzip the package to extract the binary named `consul-nia`. Move the consul-nia binary to a location available on your `$PATH`.

  1. Download a pre-compiled, released version from the [Consul NIA release page](https://releases.hashicorp.com/consul-nia/).
  1. Extract the binary using `unzip` or `tar`.
  1. Move the binary into `$PATH`.

```shell
$ wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/consul-nia/${VERSION}/consul-esm_${VERSION}_${OS}_${ARCH}.zip
$ unzip consul_nia_${VERSION}_${OS}_${ARCH}.zip
$ mv consul-nia /usr/local/bin/consul-nia
```

### Build from Source

You can also build Consul NIA from source.

  1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
  1. Pick a [version](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-nia/releases) or build from master.
  1. Build Consul NIA using the [Makefile](Makefile).
  1. The `consul-nia` binary is now installed to `$GOPATH/bin`.

$ cd consul-nia
$ git fetch --all
$ git checkout tags/vX.Y.Z
